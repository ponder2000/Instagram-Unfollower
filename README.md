## see who unfollowed you 🙎‍♂️
## and let's unfollow them back :-P (KARMA)

Instagram scaled back its API dramatically so we use a bot 🤖

I have used geckodriver that is driver for firefox.
First setup geckodriver and replace it's path in the code and I hope it will work fine :)


you must create a file: `details.py` with variables for
`username` and `password` for this to work
the code will take care of the personalities who are verified users but you have to manually add some whitelist people like your  crush and some genuine pages that you don't want to unfollow. Add them into whitelist of the 'details.py file
